`urls.py` is a Python program that collects the data URLs tweeted by
[@hindsightfiles](https://twitter.com/hindsightfiles) and makes sure that they
are archived at the Internet Archive. It outputs a CSV file containing
information about the URLs that were found and archived. Along the way the
program also will archive each of the tweets that @hindsightfiles has sent at
the Internet Archive.

Here is the list of zip files that have been tweeted so far with their HTTPS
address (generated from `urls.csv` with `readme.py`):
