The repository contains a small Python program `urls.py` that collects the data
URLs tweeted by [@hindsightfiles](https://twitter.com/hindsightfiles) and makes
sure that they are archived at the Internet Archive.

It outputs a CSV file `urls.csv` that contains information about the URLs that
were found and archived. Along the way the program also will archive each of the
tweets and any data files that @hindsightfiles has sent.

In case you don't like reading CSV here is the list of the zip files that have
been tweeted with their HTTPS address. This list is generated from `urls.csv`
with `readme.py`
